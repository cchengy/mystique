## Now
Implementing owner-requested capability-aware routing. Every mission must rank the available
agents first, and Reasoning Bank routing outcomes must improve later rankings.

## Claims
- `mystique/roteamento.py` — capability catalog and adaptive ranker
- `mystique/mundo.py` — minimal routing lifecycle integration
- `mystique/ferramentas.py` — capability map/routing tools
- `mystique/persona.py` — route-before-contact invariant
- `tests/test_offline.py` — routing and learning regressions

## Contracts I publish
- `Mundo.rotear_tarefa(task)` returns a ranked, human-readable recommendation and stores the
  route context for the next contact.
- Reasoning Bank entries with `source_kind=roteamento` and success/failure outcomes affect future
  rankings; failures are retained rather than discarded.

## Blocked on
- nothing

## Recent
- 14:44 took over the listed engine/test paths from stale `cchengy-claude` claim (updated 12:40),
  limited to the owner-requested router; no UI or deployment paths are touched.
